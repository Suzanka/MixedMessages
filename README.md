# MixedMessages
Portfolio Project - Codecademy 2024 (Full-stack path)

## About this project:
I work as a Content Developer at Amazon, and for this project, I built a message generator that creates memes in both Polish and English. The messages focus on our daily struggles and the challenges of our workload. Every time a user runs the program, they receive a new, randomized meme that captures a relatable moment from our work life. I utilized my knowledge of JavaScript to build this program and customized it to reflect the humor and struggles of our everyday tasks.

## Features of the Meme Generator:

1. *Language Selection*:
Users can choose between two languages, English and Polish, to generate memes. This feature provides flexibility, allowing the program to adapt to different language preferences.

2. *Interactive Button*:
The program includes a "Run!" button that, when clicked, triggers the generation of a new meme. This interactive element makes it easy for users to get a fresh meme with each click.

3. *Dynamic Output*:
After selecting a language and pressing the Run! button, the program outputs a randomized meme. The generated message is a mix of humorous or relatable content based on daily struggles and workload challenges, making it relevant to the users.

4. *User-Friendly Interface*:
The design is simple and intuitive. The interface is built using HTML, where users can easily choose their preferred language using radio buttons, and the "Run!" button is clearly visible to generate a new message.

5. *Responsive Layout*:
The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience whether the user is interacting with the program on a desktop or mobile device.
